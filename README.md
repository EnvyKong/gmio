C library for geometry input/output
===========================================

gmio is a reusable C library providing complete I/O support for various CAD file
formats(eg. [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29))

gmio aims to be [fast](https://github.com/fougue/gmio/wiki/4.-Benchmarks),
portable(C90 conformance) and feature-rich.

Main highlights:

  * [x] "Abstract" streams that does not tie the user to C stream(`FILE*`)
  * [x] Buffering of input/ouput for efficient device usage
  * [x] Operations can be easily aborted
  * [x] Progress report about the I/O operation
  * [x] Available under the CeCILL-B license, which is fully BSD compatible


Supported CAD files format
==========================

Current version only supports the STereoLithography format(STL), see module
[gmio_stl](http://www.fougue.pro/docs/gmio/group__gmio__stl.html#details)


Building gmio
=============

gmio can be built with CMake, by default a static library is generated.

Read the [Build instructions](https://github.com/fougue/gmio/wiki/2.-Build-instructions)


Documentation
=============

The HTML reference manual generated by Doxygen is [here](http://www.fougue.pro/docs/gmio)

There is also a [wiki](https://github.com/fougue/gmio/wiki)


Getting help
============

For now use the gmio issue tracking system provided by GitHub at
https://github.com/fougue/gmio/issues

Just create an issue with label `help wanted` or `question`.


How to report a bug
===================

The gmio bug tracking system is open to the public at
https://github.com/fougue/gmio/issues.

If you think you have found a bug in gmio, we would like to hear
about it so that we can fix it.

Always include the following information in your bug report:
  * the name and version number of your compiler
  * the name and version number of your operating system
  * the version of gmio you are using
  * what configure options it was compiled with.

If the problem you are reporting is only visible at run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run.
